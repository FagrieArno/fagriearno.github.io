                        <p>Fusarium verticillioides (Sacc.) Nirenberg (syn. F. moniliforme Sheldon) is the predominant causal agent of Fusarium ear rot (FER) of maize, a global economically important disease. Infected maize plants not only yield less kernels with a lower quality but could also be contaminated with the mycotoxin, fumonisins, which are detrimental to humans and animal health. Maize genotypes with complete resistance to FER and fumonisins have not been reported, however, genotypic variation in resistance to the disease exist. Enhancing host resistance is the most promising management strategy for FER. A better understanding is required regarding the molecular events and polygenic genes involved in resistance to ultimately speed up progress in breeding for resistance. This study aims to evaluate existing defense-related, gene-specific markers by Lanubile et al. (2010) and two novel gene-specific markers associated with resistance in maize to FER. Two maize inbred lines with contrasting genotypes, CML390 (resistant) and R2565Y(susceptible) were artificially inoculated with F. verticillioides after which kernels were harvested and subjected to RNA extraction. The expression of pathogen-related (PR) proteins such as chitinase and glucanase were analysed through semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Different banding patterns and amplification product intensities differed between inbred lines CML390 and R2565Y. Quantification of fungal DNA in the two maize inbred lines revealed that the resistant maize inbred line had lower fungal colonization than the susceptible maize inbred line. Deeper knowledge of molecular events and genetic basis underlying Fusarium ear rot is necessary to speed up progress in breeding for resistance.</p>

                        <h3>The incidence and severity of Fusarium crown rot of wheat under different crop rotation systems and tillage practices in the Western Cape</h3>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum, is an economically important disease of wheat globally and in the Western Cape province, where roughly 50% of South Africa's wheat is produced. FCR management relies on integrating agronomical practices and the use of tolerant wheat cultivars. Western Cape wheat producers practice mostly conservation agriculture, which includes crop rotation and reduced tillage practices. The latter raises concern as several studies reported an increased disease incidence under reduced tillage. In this study, the effect of four crop rotation systems (wheat-canola-wheat-lupin; wheat-lupin-wheat-canola; wheat-medic-wheat-medic; wheat monoculture) combined with four different tillage practices (conventional, minimum, no and zero tillage) on FCR disease and grain yield and quality parameters was determined. The study was conducted at two locations representative of the two wheat-growing regions of the Western Cape (Langgewens in the Swartland region and Tygerhoek in the southern Cape region) during 2018 and 2019, respectively. Disease assessments conducted on wheat crown tissue included disease incidence (percentage of infected plants), disease severity (length of visible lesions on tillers) and the quantification of F. pseudograminearum target DNA. Disease assessments were correlated with agronomical data, including grain yield, hectolitre mass (HLM) and thousand kernel weight (TKW). Crop rotation with canola, lupin and medics significantly reduced disease incidence (P = 0.0134) percentage diseased tillers (P = 0.0052) and target fungal DNA (P = 0,0010) at both localities, compared to the wheat monoculture. Zero tillage significantly reduced all disease parameters in both years at both locations, compared to conventional-, minimum- and no tillage, although no till also significantly reduced (P = 0.0258) disease incidence during 2019. Disease and agronomical parameters were significantly negatively correlated especially at Tygerhoek, demonstrating the impact of FCR on agronomical parameters. Conservation agriculture practices like crop rotation with broadleaf crops in combination with zero tillage can, therefore, contribute to effectively managing FCR.</p>

                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                        <p>Fusarium crown rot (FCR) and Fusarium head blight (FHB) are economically important wheat diseases associated with the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum. These diseases result in the necrosis of the lower stem, in the case of FCR, and premature bleaching of the spikelets in the case of FHB, leading to a reduction in yield and the possible contamination of grain with mycotoxins like deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. The epidemiological differences between FHB and FCR raise the question whether there is genetic differentiation between F. pseudograminearum populations responsible for the two diseases. Using nine simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, we characterise patterns underlying the genetic structure associated with FCR and FHB from six localities in the Western Cape, South Africa. A high degree of intrapopulation genetic variation was observed, with low interpopulation variation, implying that the isolates originated from a larger metapopulation. Population structuring was evident between certain localities, revealing three population clusters within the Western Cape wheat production area, indicative of higher gene flow within these clusters. The populations derived from the respective diseases, were not genetically distinct, based on low pairwise differentiation and shared multilocus genotypes, suggesting the aetiology of FCR and FHB could be linked to favourable environmental conditions, rather than genetic differentiation. The populations were further characterised by determining the mating type and toxigenic potential. Most of the isolates exhibited the 3-ADON trichothecene genotype. In all populations the mating types, MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 was present at a near 1:1 ratio, indicating the potential for sexual reproduction.</p>
